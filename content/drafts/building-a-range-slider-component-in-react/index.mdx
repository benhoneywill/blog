HTML inputs can have a type of `"range"`, but these native range inputs have some limitations. The most obvious
limitation is that these range sliders do not support multiple handles!

Today we are going to build a multi-handled range input in React, and we are going to do it by leveraging the existing
functionality of the native range input. This means that we won't have to worry about writing our own drag and drop
system, and we won't have to include a 3rd party drag and drop npm package.

###### Here is a native range input

<Container>
  <input type="range" min={0} max={100} step={5} />
</Container>

###### And here is what we will learn to build today

<Container>
  <RangeSlider min={0} max={100} step={5} />
</Container>

## Let's get started!
