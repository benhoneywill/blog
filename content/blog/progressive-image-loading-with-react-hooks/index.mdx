Last week I was building a web page for our e-commerce site, the design had a really beautiful large
hero image that took up half the width of the screen. After implementing the design I noticed
that on slower internet connections this beautiful large image loaded *very* slowly.

The designer intended any user's first impression of this page to be __Wow, look at that beautiful imagery__.
Unfortunately as the image was so large they were instead presented with a bland page while it loaded.

##### An example of the problem

import ProblemExample from './components/problem-example';

<ProblemExample />

Hopefully you can see that the image loads quite slowly. If not then... congratulations on your super-fast
internet connection! Hopefully you can still follow along by *imagining* it was slow to load.

##### How to solve this problem?

Obviously I couldn't let this fly. I wanted to come up with a reusable solution that allowed
me to show a representation of the image while it loaded, as this would let me stick to the designer's
initial vision.

There is a technique commonly know as "Blurring Up" images. This involves initially rendering a very small
image, scaling it up and then applying a Gaussian Blur. This method is what I settled on using, and I think the
result is pretty good.

Below is an example of the finished product. Compare it to the slow version above, what do you think?

import FinishedExample from './components/finished-example';

<FinishedExample />

I think it works very nicely. One of the most important things for me when implementing this was that I wanted
it to be reusable, as I wanted to easily add this effect whenever I was dealing with a large image. I also wanted it
to work for both `<img />` tags and background images, as we use a mixture of these depending on the context.

##### The solution

Whenever I am working in React and want something reusable I think "Could I make this a hook?”.
Check out the code below.

```js
import React from 'react';

const useProgressiveImg = (lowQualitySrc, highQualitySrc) => {
  const [src, setSrc] = React.useState(lowQualitySrc);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    setSrc(lowQualitySrc);

    const img = new Image();
    img.src = highQualitySrc;

    img.onload = () => {
      setSrc(highQualitySrc);
    };
  }, [lowQualitySrc, highQualitySrc]);

  return [src, { blur: src === lowQualitySrc }];
};

export default useProgressiveImg;
```

This is a hook which accepts two arguments: a low-quality image `src`, and a high-quality image `src`.

By default this hook will return the `src` of the low-quality pixelated image.
Once the higher quality image has loaded, it will return that instead.
This is achieved by adding an event listener to a new `Image` object. The `src` attribute of this `Image`
is set to the `src` of our __high quality image__, so the event listener fires once the full-size image has loaded.

Once that image has loaded we switch from returning the pixelated image to returning the full-size image.

You may have also noticed that this hook returns a second value, which is an object containing a value
I have called `blur`. We can use this to know whether or not we need to "blur" the image. If the current
`src` being returned is that of the the low-quality image, then we should blur the image, as that is the
nasty pixelated one.

##### Usage

Here is an example of how to use this hook to get the desired "blur up" effect.

```js
import React from "react";
import useProgressiveImg from "./useProgressiveImg";

const BlurredUpImage = () => {
  const [src, { blur }] = useProgressiveImg(
    "./tiny.jpg",
    "./large.jpg"
  );

  return (
    <img
      src={src}
      style={{
        width: 200,
        filter: blur
          ? "blur(20px)"
          : "none",
        transition: blur
          ? "none"
          : "filter 0.3s ease-out"
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

In this example `tiny.jpg` should be a very small version of the full-size image `large.jpg`.

I have used inline styles here for simplicity's sake, but you could also use the `blur` value to toggle a
class, or pass it in as a prop to a styled component. The important thing here is that we are adding a
CSS `blur()` filter if the image hasn't loaded yet. The `transition` makes the transition between the
blurred and non-blurred states nice and smooth.
