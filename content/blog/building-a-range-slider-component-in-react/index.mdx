HTML inputs can have a type of `"range"`, but these native range inputs have some limitations. The most obvious
limitation is that these range sliders do not support multiple handles!

Today we are going to build a multi-handled range input in React, and we are going to do it by leveraging the existing
functionality of the **native range input**.

This means that we won't have to worry about writing our own drag and drop system, and we won't
have to include a 3rd party drag and drop npm package. We can also rely on native browser behaviour for
some of the acessibility concerns you would normally have when building something like this.

###### Here is a native range input

<Container>
  <input type="range" min={0} max={100} step={5} />
</Container>

###### And here is what we will learn to build today

<Container>
  <RangeSlider min={0} max={100} step={5} />
</Container>

### Let's get started!

A multi-range input is essentially just two range inputs:

- One input that represents the min value
- One input that represents the max value
- The min value must never be higher than the max value
- And the max value can never be lower than the min value

Sound simple? Well, with that in mind, check out the example below.

<Container>
  <Model min={0} max={100} step={5} />
</Container>
